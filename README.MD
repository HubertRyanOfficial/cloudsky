# [Cloudsky.app](https://cloudsky.app)

Cloudsky is an open source project to create and note details of a project, thus better organize the notes of a company and so on with local store for now.
The goal of this project is to include and learn more about next js and react js technologies with web concepts like SSR and SSG. Feel free to submit ideas and continue on this mission!

### Technologies used

- [x] Next JS
- [x] Typescript
- [x] Framer Motion
- [x] Lottie Animations

**Why Next JS?**

With each passing year, we need to understand even more the concepts that are dominating the front-end world. So in addition to being the main reasons for creating this project, it will help us to better understand the structure and how to apply it with the SSR and SSG concepts.

**Why Typescript?**

Typescript has helped us a lot with typing and property awareness on external components within the application. With it, it has greatly facilitated the creation of components and the understanding of future devs in the project. This was one of the main reasons for using it.

**Framer Motion?**

Framer Motion was a great option for us to expand animations today in the react ecosystem. Framer has been coming with new features and facilitating animations with JSX. I strongly recommend using it in any application.

**Why Lottie?**

Lottie makes complex animations a lot easier when it comes to animations in seconds and can be easily created using Adobe Affter Effects, taking away from the large library of ready-to-use animations.
